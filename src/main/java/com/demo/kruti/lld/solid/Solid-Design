1. SOLID PRINCIPLES OF OOPS

S - Single resp principle - a class have only one reason to change and only one responsibility
O - Open/Close principle - open for extension but closed for modification
L - Liskov Substitution Principle - subclass should replace the capability of parent class not narrow it down.
I - Interface Segmented Principle- interface should be such that client should not implement unnecessary
D - Dependency Inversion Principle - class should  depend on interface rather than concrete class

Advantages:

1. Easy to maintain
2. avoid duplicate code
3. easy to understand
4. flexible
5. reduce complexity
